== Welcome to Defribillator

This is just a little dashboard, showing teh status of several cijoe projects
(or something else, we will see)

1) setup your rails app as you want
2) use script/update to setup your projects

script/update Project lasers status:ok

The above command will create a Project called "lasers" (if it does not exist
already) and will update its status attribute to "ok". A project_update
will be creatd, too - it will act as a log.

may teh forz be with yu.
